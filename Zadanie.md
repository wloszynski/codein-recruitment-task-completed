## Assignment

Currently, all items are in root level. Please add an option to allow us to have multi-level tasks (task, subtask, subtask of a subtask). It would also be nice to have an inline rename function. Refactor it to be fully compliant with Vue2 and Vuex design patterns and use ONLY already installed tools.

After finishing the task please fill the information below and put the project files inside a new github repository and pass over the link.

There’s no time limit, but we’d love to hear how much time had you spent on this task.
